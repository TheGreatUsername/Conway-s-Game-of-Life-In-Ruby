# Conway-s-Game-of-Life-In-Ruby
This is a short but versatile program written in Ruby. It asks you to provide a width and height and generates a random game of life board of specified dimensions. You then have the option generation by generation to toggle cells, progress to the next generation, or terminate the program.
